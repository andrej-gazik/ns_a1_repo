# TENSORFLOW SOLUTION 
- [X] From test -> validation and then test
- [X] Add dropout with probability specification for the model
- [X] Add dynamic model layer specification
- [X] Hook config to the code 
- [ ] Add different initialization of weights
- [ ] Add generation of architecture for the model and log it into the WandB
  
# PyTorch Solution
- [X] Add dropout with probability specification for the model 
- [X] Add dynamic model layer specification
- [ ] Add validation and test 
- [ ] Hook config to the code 
- [ ] Add different initialization of weights
- [ ] Add generation of architecture for the model and log it into the WandB


# Global 
- [X] Add config file for the both solutions and change config globally for more flexibility
- [ ] Loss function and optimizer should be in the config file
- [ ] Add more comments in the code 
- [ ]  **(Optional)** Find how to run whole notebook from script and change parameters in the python file dynamically and log results 
- [ ] Comment on code and explain what is happening in MarkDown cells
